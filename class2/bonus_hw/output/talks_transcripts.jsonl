Why is that? And I'll tell you why. Most of you think of AI as, I'll just use the general term as chat GPT. For most of you, chat GP was the moment where you said, oh my god, this thing writes. And it makes mistakes, but it's so brilliantly verbal. Right, that was certainly my reaction. Most people that I knew did that. It was visceral, yeah. This was two years ago. Since then, the gains in what is called reinforcement learning, which is what AlphaGo helped invent. And so forth, allow us to do planning. And a good example is look at OpenAI-03 or deep seek R1. And you can see how it goes forward and back, forward and back, forward and back. It's extraordinary. In my case, I bought a rocket company, because it was like interesting. And I know, as one does. As one does. And it's an area that I'm not an expert in. And I want to be an expert. So I'm using deep research. And these systems are spending 15 minutes writing these deep papers. It's true for most of them. Do you have any idea how much computation? 15 minutes of these supercomputers is? It's extraordinary. So you're seeing the arrival, the shift from language to language. Then you have language to sequence, which is how biology is done. Now you're doing essentially planning and strategy. The eventual state of this is the computer's running all business processes. So you have an agent to do this, an agent to do this, an agent to do this, an agent to do this. And you can catenate them together. And they speak language among each other. So when I look at this future, I want to be clear that the arrival of this intelligence, both at the AI level, the AGI, which is general intelligence, and then super intelligence, is the most important thing that's going to happen in about 500 years, maybe 1,000 years in human society. And it's happening in our lifetime.

You're incredibly good at asking questions and prompting AI is very similar. You can't just randomly ask a bunch of questions. And so asking AI to be an assistant to you requires some expertise in an artistry and how to prompt it. And so if I were a student today, irrespective of whether it's for math or for science or chemistry or biology or it doesn't matter what field of science I'm going to go into or what profession I am, I'm going to ask myself how can I use AI to do my job better?", "segments": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 3.7, "text": "For example, if I were a student today, the first thing I would do is to learn AI."}, {"start": 4.14, "end": 6.68, "text": "How do I learn to interact with chat GPT?"}, {"start": 6.82, "end": 8.74, "text": "How do I learn to interact with Gemini Pro?"}, {"start": 9.06, "end": 15.14, "text": "And how do I learn to interact with Gurok and learning how to interact with AI is not"}, {"start": 15.14, "end": 19.18, "text": "unlike being someone who is really good at asking questions."}, {"start": 19.98, "end": 25.62, "text": "You're incredibly good at asking questions and prompting AI is very similar."}, {"start": 25.62, "end": 29.6, "text": "You can't just randomly ask a bunch of questions."}, {"start": 30.12, "end": 37.3, "text": "And so asking AI to be an assistant to you requires some expertise in an artistry and"}, {"start": 37.3, "end": 37.92, "text": "how to prompt it."}, {"start": 38.5, "end": 44.22, "text": "And so if I were a student today, irrespective of whether it's for math or for science or"}, {"start": 44.22, "end": 47.58, "text": "chemistry or biology or it doesn't matter what field of science I'm going to go into"}, {"start": 47.58, "end": 52.56, "text": "or what profession I am, I'm going to ask myself how can I use AI to do my job better?"}]}
